        <h3>Cities I've lived in:</h3>
            <ul> 
                <li> Destin, FL <span>- Hometown</span></li>
                <li> Colorado Springs, CO <span>- College</span></li>
                <li> Los Angeles, CA <span>- Current base</span></li>  
            </ul> 
            <p>I grew up in Florida and then went to USAFA in Colorado Springs and now I'm stationed in LA!</p>

        <h3>Cities I want to visit:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Tokyo<span>- Childhood dream</span></li>
            <li> Rome<span>- Because I'm interested in Italy</span></li>
            <li> Miami<span>- I'm a Floridian that's never been to Miami, like c'mon</span></li>
        </ol> 
        <p> I've always wanted to go to Tokyo ever since I was a kid so that's number one easily. However, recently
            I've been interested in learning Italian and going to Italy, so I Googled most iconic cities and 
            Rome seemed like the winner. (Remember the 'Roman Empire' meme?) And lastly, even though I grew up in 
            Florida, I've actually never been to Miami! So, I've prioritized that need for a Miami Girls Trip here.
