        <h3>Cities I've Lived In</h3>
        <p> I grew up in Florida and then went to USAFA in Colorado Springs and now I'm stationed in LA!</p>
        <ul> 
          <li> Destin, FL <span>- Hometown</span></li>
          <li> Colorado Springs, CO <span>- College</span></li>
          <li> Los Angeles, CA <span>- Current base</span></li>  
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
        <p> I've always wanted to go to Tokyo ever since I was a kid so that's number one easily. However, recently
            I've been interested in learning Italian and going to Italy, so I Googled most iconic cities and 
            Rome seemed like the winner. (Remember the 'Roman Empire' meme?) And lastly, even though I grew up in 
            Florida, I've actually never been to Miami! So, I've prioritized that need for a Miami Girls Trip here. 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Tokyo</strong></li>
            <li> <em>Rome</em></li>
            <li> <strong>Miami</strong></li>
